A quadratic equation is in the form of 𝒂𝒙² + 𝒃𝒙 + 𝒄 = 0. Just as 𝒙² = 1 has two solutions, quadratic equations can also have (and at most have) 2 solutions. Note the word “can” because there may be “repeated roots”.

A quadratic equation may be factorized into the form (𝒙 − 𝒓₁)(𝒙 − 𝒓₂) = 0, and the solutions are 𝒙 = 𝒓₁ or 𝒓₂. Several methods may be applied for the factorization, which can be found in this website:

For a more general method of solving quadratic equations, the roots are given by the quadratic formula. See:

As an exercise, try deriving the sum of roots, 𝒓₁ + 𝒓₂, and product of roots, 𝒓₁𝒓₂, in terms of 𝒂, 𝒃 and 𝒄. You will find that 𝒓₁ + 𝒓₂ = − 𝒃/𝒂 and 𝒓₁𝒓₂ = 𝒄/𝒂.

A quadratic graph has the form 𝒚 = 𝒂𝒙² + 𝒃𝒙 + 𝒄. It is a parabola. There are several properties of the parabola which can be found from the equation, namely the opening direction, the number of x-intercepts, the coordinates of vertices etc. Refer to the following website:

The “Completing the Square” method may be applied to find the maximum or minimum value of a quadratic formula. It involves writing 𝒂𝒙² + 𝒃𝒙 + 𝒄 into the form 𝒂(𝒙 – 𝒉)² + 𝒌. The maximum value is 𝒌, achieved at 𝒙 = 𝒉. For the derivation of the formula of 𝒉 and 𝒌, see the following website:

The following website covers interesting real world applications of quadratic equations in the field of physics. It does not require any knowledge about physics so don’t be afraid to read it:
