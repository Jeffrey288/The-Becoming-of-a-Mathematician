The type of questions you will practice in this level is
-	Geometric Sequence
-	Polynomials: the factor theorem and the remainder theorem

Note: There will be questions in this game where you have to guess a root in the polynomial, the factorize the whole thing (Don’t blame me :)). The range of the roots are given as follows:
Integer: from -7 to 7
Fraction: denominators are not greater than 6, the value is not greater than 2.

 (The formulas cannot be displayed here well, so no formula sheet is given.)

The division algorithm of a polynomial is given by
𝑷(𝒙) = 𝑫(𝒙) 𝑸(𝒙) + 𝑹(𝒙)
where 𝑷 is a polynomial (and the dividend), 𝑫 is the divisor, and 𝑸, 𝑹 are the quotient and remainder respectively. Visit this website for examples:

The remainder theorem states that when a polynomial 𝑷(𝒙) is divided by 𝒙 – 𝒂, the remainder is 𝑷(𝒂). An immediate consequence is that when 𝑷(𝒂) is 0, 𝒙 – 𝒂 is a root of 𝑷(𝒙). This is the factor theorem. Please refer to this website:

This concept applies to polynomials: factorize the polynomials, and find the GCF by comparing these factors.
