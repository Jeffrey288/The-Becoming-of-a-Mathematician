Formula sheet:

General formula: 𝑻(𝒏) = 𝒂 + 𝒅(𝒏 − 1), 
where 𝑻(𝒏) is the 𝒏 th term of the sequence
𝒂 is the first term, and
𝒅 is the common difference.

𝑺(𝒏) = ½ 𝒏(𝒂 + 𝒍) = ½ 𝒏(2𝒂 + 𝒅(𝒏 − 1))
where 𝑺(𝒏) is the sum of the first 𝒏 terms of the sequence, and
𝒍 = 𝒂 + 𝒅(𝒏 − 1) is the last term of the section of the sequence.
